# fp-makes-life-easier

This repository holds the pptx and sources for a presentation I give about Functional Programming.

In the `Source\Samples` dir there's a solution consisting of some explanations of functional concepts which are mentioned in the pptx, which is found in the `Presentation` dir (switch to the `samples` branch -- you can move through commits).
The `Source\Calender` dir holds a solution which I refactor from `OOP` to a `FP` manner. This also has a `readme.md` explaining the fake domain and branches marking the changes (switch to the `oop` branch to start).
